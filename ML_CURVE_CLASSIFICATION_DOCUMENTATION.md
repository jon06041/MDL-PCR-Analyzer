# ML Curve Classification & qPCR Logic Reference - Updated July 23, 2025

## Overview

The MDL PCR Analyzer includes an advanced Machine Learning (ML) curve classification system that can learn from expert feedback to improve qPCR result classification accuracy. This system uses a RandomForestClassifier trained on **30 hybrid features** (18 numerical + 12 visual pattern features) to predict classifications across **7 distinct classes**.

## Development Branches (July 2025)

### Current Branch Structure:
- **`main`** - Default production branch
- **`ml-curve-classifier-training`** - Production ML system (37 training samples, active models)
- **`ml-curve-classifier-training-threshold-fixes`** - Current development branch for threshold-specific fixes

### Branch Focus: Threshold Issues Investigation (July 23, 2025)
**Purpose**: Address test-specific threshold problems while maintaining the robust ML training system from the parent branch.

**Key Areas of Investigation**:
- Integration of ML predictions with traditional threshold-based classification rules
- Test-specific threshold calibration for improved accuracy
- Borderline amplitude handling improvements (400-500 RFU range)
- Channel-specific thresholding for multi-fluorophore experiments

**Current Context**: Working from a production ML system with 37 training samples and functional models, now focusing on threshold-related classification issues that affect accuracy for specific test types.
- Channel-specific thresholding for multi-fluorophore experiments
- Consistency between ML-based and rule-based classifications

## Classification System (7 Classes + Expert Decisions)

### Complete Classification Categories:
1. **STRONG_POSITIVE** - High amplitude, excellent S-curve characteristics
2. **POSITIVE** - Clear positive amplification signal  
3. **WEAK_POSITIVE** - Low but detectable positive signal
4. **INDETERMINATE** - Unclear biological result, ambiguous signal that cannot be confidently classified
5. **REDO** - Technical issues or borderline amplitude (400-500 RFU), repeat test recommended
6. **SUSPICIOUS** - Questionable result that may need further investigation or expert review
7. **NEGATIVE** - No significant amplification signal

### Expert Decision System:
- **Expert Review Method**: When experts provide feedback, their decision overrides both ML and rule-based classifications
- **Expert Decision Display**: Shows "👨‍⚕️ Expert Review" with "(Expert Decision)" confidence indicator
- **Expert Decision Priority**: Expert classifications take precedence and are displayed immediately without re-analysis
- **Expert Feedback Storage**: Expert decisions are stored with `expert_classification`, `expert_review_method`, and timestamp

### Key Distinctions:
- **INDETERMINATE vs SUSPICIOUS**: INDETERMINATE is for biologically unclear results; SUSPICIOUS is for technically questionable results
- **REDO vs SUSPICIOUS**: REDO is for specific technical issues (borderline amplitude); SUSPICIOUS is for broader quality concerns
- **All classes serve distinct diagnostic purposes** and should be preserved in training data

## Recent System Enhancements (January 2025)

### Multichannel ML Support
- **Fixed**: ML warning banners and progress notifications now appear for multichannel experiments
- **Enhancement**: Added `checkForAutomaticMLAnalysis()` call to `displayMultiFluorophoreResults()` function
- **Impact**: ML notifications now trigger properly for multi-fluorophore uploads (Cy5, FAM, HEX, Texas Red)

### Duplicate Submission Prevention
- **Fixed**: Aggressive triple-layer protection against duplicate ML feedback submissions
- **Implementation**: Event prevention + local flags + button state management
- **Result**: Single-click submissions only, prevents server overload and data corruption

### Visual Curve Analysis Improvements
- **Enhanced**: Robust field detection for RFU data across different naming conventions
- **Added**: Metrics-based analysis fallback when raw curve data unavailable
- **Improved**: Debug logging and error handling for SUSPICIOUS samples
- **Support**: Multiple field names (`rfu_data`, `raw_rfu`, `rfu`, `fluorescence_data`)

### Expert Review System Safeguards
- **Threshold Protection**: Expert review conflicts only appear after 50+ training samples
- **Confidence Requirements**: ML must have ≥70% confidence to suggest conflicts
- **Visual Indicators**: Training progress bar shows progress toward expert review threshold
- **User Experience**: Clear status updates and tooltips explain requirements

### ML Configuration Visibility Control Fix
- **Fixed**: ML section visibility control for pathogen-specific configurations
- **Issue**: `extractChannelSpecificPathogen()` returned only `channel` property, but `shouldHideMLFeedback()` looked for `fluorophore` property
- **Solution**: Added `fluorophore` property to the return object, ensuring compatibility with existing app logic
- **Impact**: ML sections now hide correctly when `ml_enabled: false` in pathogen-specific configurations
- **Consistency**: Maintains app-wide pattern where `fluorophore` and `channel` are treated interchangeably

This document serves as a comprehensive reference for both ML classification and traditional rule-based qPCR curve analysis logic.

## S-Curve Definition & Quality Metrics

### What is an S-Curve?
An **S-curve** in qPCR is a characteristic amplification curve that rises slowly at first (baseline), then rapidly (exponential phase), and finally plateaus (saturation). A good S-curve indicates true amplification and is the foundation for calling a well positive.

### S-curve Quality Criteria

**Original S-curve criteria:**
- The curve must fit a sigmoid model: `sigmoid(cycles, L, k, x0, B)`
- **Fit quality (R²):** Must be >0.9 (if >20 cycles) or >0.85 (if ≤20 cycles)
- **Steepness (k):** Must be >0.05
- **Amplitude (L):** Must be >max(50, rfu_range * 0.3)

**Enhanced S-curve criteria:**
- All original criteria, **plus** additional quality filters:
  - **Amplification start cycle:** Must be after a minimum cycle (e.g., ≥8)
  - **Minimum amplitude:** Must be above a set value (e.g., ≥100)
  - **Plateau significance:** The curve must reach a high enough plateau (e.g., ≥50 RFU)
  - **Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR):** Must be ≥3.0
  - **Exponential growth rate:** Must be ≥5.0
- **Steepness (k) in enhanced version:** Sometimes raised to >0.1 for stricter classification

**If any of these criteria fail, a rejection reason is recorded (e.g., "Poor R² fit", "Insufficient amplitude").**

## Classification Methods

### 1. Rule-Based Classification (Default)
When no trained ML model is available, the system uses threshold-based logic:

**POS Criteria:**
- ✅ Good S-curve fit (`is_good_scurve = true`)
- ✅ Amplitude ≥ 400 RFU
- ✅ No anomalies detected
- ✅ Valid Cq value (not NaN)

**NEG Criteria:**
- ❌ Amplitude < 400 RFU, OR
- ❌ Poor S-curve fit, OR  
- ❌ Invalid Cq value

**REDO Criteria:**
- ⚠️ Everything else (e.g., has anomalies but meets other POS criteria)

### 2. Hybrid ML Classification (When Trained)
After sufficient expert feedback is provided, the system switches to hybrid ML-based classification using **30 features** extracted from the amplification curves:
- **18 Numerical Features**: Statistical and mathematical curve properties
- **12 Visual Pattern Features**: Shape, baseline, noise, and curve progression patterns

### 3. Expert Review System (Override Method)
When experts provide feedback through the ML interface:
- **Immediate Override**: Expert decisions immediately override ML and rule-based classifications
- **Persistent Storage**: Expert classifications are stored and displayed on subsequent views
- **Visual Indicators**: Expert decisions show special UI styling with "👨‍⚕️ Expert Review" method
- **Clear Functionality**: Experts can clear their previous decisions to get fresh ML predictions
- **Training Integration**: Expert feedback is used to train and improve the ML model

This hybrid approach combines automated analysis with expert oversight, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy.

- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues working with partial data
- **Clear Error Messages**: Indicates available recovery sources
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing features preserved

**Result**: Eliminates "No well data available" errors while maintaining all ML feedback functionality.

## Training Process

### Phase 1: Data Collection
1. **Expert Review**: Users open sample modals and review automated classifications
2. **Feedback Submission**: When automation is incorrect, experts provide correct classification
3. **Hybrid Feature Extraction**: System automatically extracts 30 features (18 numerical + 12 visual) from curve data
4. **Data Storage**: Training examples are saved to `ml_training_data.json` with enhanced feature set

### Phase 2: Model Training
Training occurs automatically when sufficient data is available:
- **Minimum Threshold**: 10 training examples required
- **Trigger**: Automatic training after each feedback submission
- **Algorithm**: RandomForestClassifier (scikit-learn)
- **Parameters**: 100 estimators, max_depth=10, random_state=42

### Phase 2.5: Expert Decision System
Expert decisions provide immediate classification override:

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components
- **`ml_curve_classifier.py`**: Core ML training and prediction logic
- **`threshold_backend.py`**: Handles feature extraction and data persistence
- **`qpcr_analyzer.py`**: Integrates ML predictions into analysis pipeline

### Frontend Components

- **`script.js`**: Modal integration and data handling
- **Result classification logic**: Determines POS/NEG/REDO based on method

## Variable Definitions & Core Metrics

All calculations and classifications are performed **per channel** (i.e., for each fluorophore independently).

### Core Sigmoid Parameters
- **L (Amplitude):** The height of the fitted sigmoid curve, representing the maximum RFU (Relative Fluorescence Units) minus baseline. Example: If baseline is 100 and max RFU is 600, then L ≈ 500.
- **k (Steepness):** The slope of the sigmoid at its inflection point. Must be >0.05 for a good S-curve.
- **x0 (Inflection Point):** The cycle at which the curve rises most steeply.
- **B (Baseline):** The average RFU of the first 5 cycles (background signal).
- **r2_score:** The coefficient of determination for the sigmoid fit. Must be >0.9 (if >20 cycles) or >0.85 (if ≤20 cycles) for a good S-curve.

### Quality Metrics
- **amplitude:** Usually the same as L.
- **plateau_level:** The mean RFU of the last 5 cycles, used to check if the curve plateaus at a high enough value.
- **snr (Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** Ratio of the amplitude to the standard deviation of the baseline. Must be ≥3.0 for a good S-curve.
- **growth_rate:** The maximum slope in the exponential phase. Must be ≥5.0 for a good S-curve.
- **threshold_value:** The calculated threshold for calling amplification, usually set to the inflection point (L/2 + B), but clamped between 10% and 90% of the amplitude above baseline.
- **linear_threshold:** In some cases, a linear threshold may be used (e.g., baseline + N × std), where N is typically 10.0.

### Anomaly Detection
Anomalies are specific curve features or problems that may indicate poor data quality or non-standard amplification. They are detected per well and used in both curve classification and POS/NEG/REDO logic.

- **low_amplitude:** The total RFU change (max-min) is less than 50, or less than 10% of the expected range. Indicates little or no amplification.
- **early_plateau:** The curve plateaus (becomes flat) before the midpoint of the run, suggesting non-specific or failed amplification.
- **unstable_baseline:** The standard deviation of the baseline (cycles 6–10) is >50 or >15% of the RFU range. Indicates noisy or drifting background.
- **negative_amplification:** The RFU decreases during the expected exponential phase, which is not typical for true amplification.
- **negative_rfu_values:** The RFU is negative for a significant portion of the curve, but not consistently (i.e., not just a baseline offset). Indicates possible instrument or sample prep issues.
- **high_noise:** The standard deviation of the difference between consecutive RFU values is >30% of the RFU range. Indicates erratic signal.
- **insufficient_data:** Fewer than 5 cycles or RFU points are present.
- **insufficient_valid_data:** Fewer than 5 valid (non-NaN) cycles or RFU points.

**Note:** Anomalies are stored as a list per well. If the list is empty or only contains 'None', the curve is considered free of anomalies for POS/NEG/REDO logic.

## Curve Classification Logic

### Multi-Class Curve Classification (Backend)
The `curve_classification` logic uses a series of conditionals based on fit quality (R²), steepness, SNR, midpoint, baseline, and amplitude. These are separate from the strict S-curve boolean and POS/NEG/REDO logic.

**Classification logic (in order):**

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - If steepness > 0.8 and SNR < 5:
    - `classification = 'SUSPICIOUS'` (reason: "Possible noise spike", always flagged for review)

- **NEGATIVE:**
  - If R² is less than 0.75:
    - `classification = 'NEGATIVE'` (reason: "Poor fit")
  - If SNR is less than 2.0:
    - `classification = 'NEGATIVE'` (reason: "Low signal")

- **STRONG_POSITIVE:**
  - If R² is greater than 0.95 and steepness is greater than 0.4 and SNR is greater than 15.0:
    - `classification = 'STRONG_POSITIVE'` (reason: "Meets all strong positive criteria")

- **POSITIVE:**
  - If R² is greater than 0.85 and steepness is greater than 0.3 and SNR is greater than 8.0:
    - `classification = 'POSITIVE'` (reason: "Meets positive criteria")
  - If steepness is greater than 0.6 and SNR is greater than 3 and R² is greater than 0.80:
    - `classification = 'POSITIVE'` (reason: "Sharp transition")
  - If SNR is greater than 12 and steepness is greater than 0.15 and R² is greater than 0.85:
    - `classification = 'POSITIVE'` (reason: "Strong signal")

- **WEAK_POSITIVE:**
  - If R² is greater than 0.80 and steepness is greater than 0.2 and SNR is greater than 4.0:
    - `classification = 'WEAK_POSITIVE'` (reason: "Meets weak positive criteria")

- **INDETERMINATE:**
  - If R² is greater than 0.75 and steepness is greater than 0.1 and SNR is greater than 2.5:
    - `classification = 'INDETERMINATE'` (reason: "Manual review")

- **NEGATIVE (default):**
  - If none of the above, `classification = 'NEGATIVE'` (reason: "Does not meet criteria")

**SNR Cutoffs Summary:**
- Strong_Positive: 15.0
- Positive: 8.0
- Weak_Positive: 4.0
- Indeterminate: 2.5
- Negative: 2.0

### POS/NEG/REDO Result Logic
**Purpose:** Strict, user-facing result classification for each well.

**Logic (Both Backend & Frontend):**
- **NEG:**
  - `amplitude < 400` **OR**
  - `!is_good_scurve` **OR**
  - `Cq` is not a number
- **POS:**
  - `is_good_scurve` **AND**
  - `amplitude > 500` **AND**
  - `no anomalies`
- **REDO:**
  - All other cases (e.g., amplitude 400–500, or amplitude >500 with anomalies)

## Threshold Calculations

**Backend:**
- **Exponential Phase Threshold:**
  - `exp_phase_threshold = L / 2 + B`
  - Clamped to 10–90% of max RFU:
    ```python
    min_thresh = B + 0.10 * L
    max_thresh = B + 0.90 * L
    threshold_value = min(max(exp_phase_threshold, min_thresh), max_thresh)
    ```
- **Linear Threshold Calculation:**
  - Sometimes, a linear threshold is used for calling amplification:
    ```python
    linear_threshold = baseline + N * baseline_std
    # where N is typically 10.0
    ```
  - This is most often used for visual/manual review or as a fallback if the sigmoid fit fails.
- **User/Channel Thresholds:**
  - Used for visualization and manual overrides (frontend).

**Frontend:**
- User-settable per channel, stored in `window.userSetThresholds`.
- Used for chart overlays and UI controls.

```javascript
// Enhanced hybrid feature extraction
function extractHybridFeatures(wellData) {
    const numericalFeatures = extractNumericalFeatures(wellData);
    const visualFeatures = extractVisualPatternFeatures(wellData.rfu_data, wellData.cycles, wellData);
    
    return {
        ...numericalFeatures,
        ...visualFeatures,
        feature_count: 30,
        extraction_method: 'hybrid_numerical_visual'
    };
}

// Key visual pattern functions
function classifyCurveShape(rfuData, cycles, wellData) {
    // Returns: 0=flat, 1=linear, 2=s-curve, 3=exponential, 4=irregular
}

function calculateBaselineStability(rfuData) {
    // Measures coefficient of variation for baseline consistency
}

function detectSpikes(rfuData) {
    // Counts anomalous spikes above 3-sigma threshold
}
```

### Visual Feature Categories

## Best Practices

### For Training Data Quality
1. **Diverse Examples**: Include various curve types and quality levels
2. **Expert Consensus**: Have experienced technicians provide feedback
3. **Regular Updates**: Continuously provide feedback to improve the model
4. **Balance Classes**: Ensure good representation of POS/NEG/REDO examples

### For Operational Use
1. **Monitor Confidence**: Review low-confidence predictions manually
2. **Validate Predictions**: Spot-check ML classifications regularly
3. **Update Training**: Add feedback for any incorrect ML predictions
4. **Backup Planning**: Always maintain rule-based classification as fallback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Method: Rule-based" persists after feedback:**
- Check that at least 10 training examples are collected
- Verify feedback is being saved to `ml_training_data.json`
- Ensure no training errors in backend logs

**Low prediction confidence:**
- Model needs more diverse training examples
- Current sample may be edge case requiring expert review
- Consider adding similar examples to training set

**Inconsistent predictions:**
- Model may be overfitting to limited training data
- Add more balanced examples across all classification types
- Review feature extraction for data quality issues

### ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE: Classification Inconsistency After Feedback** (July 22, 2025)

**Problem**: A sample corrected via feedback (NEGATIVE → INDETERMINATE) was later classified as POSITIVE when re-analyzed with the updated model.

**Symptoms**:
- Expert provides feedback correcting a sample classification
- Model trains successfully on the feedback
- Re-analysis of the same sample produces a different classification than the expert feedback
- Classification "drift" from expert correction (INDETERMINATE) to automated prediction (POSITIVE)

**Potential Causes**:
1. **Feature Extraction Variance**: Slight differences in feature calculation between feedback submission and re-analysis
2. **Training Data Corruption**: Expert feedback not properly stored or retrieved during model training
3. **Model Overfitting**: Limited training data causing unstable decision boundaries
4. **Cross-Sample Influence**: Training on similar samples affecting classification of the corrected sample
5. **Threshold Boundary Issues**: Sample falling near classification boundaries with shifting decision criteria

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Verify feature consistency by logging extracted features during both feedback and re-analysis
2. Check SQLite database to ensure expert feedback is properly stored with correct classifications
3. Analyze model decision boundaries and confidence scores around the problematic sample
4. Test model stability by re-training multiple times with the same data
5. Implement feature extraction validation to ensure consistency across analysis runs

**Immediate Recommendation**: Samples showing classification inconsistency after expert feedback should be marked as **REDO** until the root cause is identified and resolved.

**Status**: 🚨 **Under Investigation** - This issue undermines ML system reliability and requires immediate attention.

**Workaround**: Until resolved, users should:
- Document any observed classification drift after providing feedback
- Re-check samples that were manually corrected in subsequent analyses
- Use the feedback interface to re-correct any samples that drift from expert classifications

## Multichannel-Aware Automatic Batch Re-evaluation System (January 2025)

### Overview
The automatic batch re-evaluation system intelligently identifies and re-analyzes similar wells when an expert corrects an ML prediction. This system respects multichannel data boundaries and automatically applies improved predictions to similar samples within the same pathogen/fluorophore combination, updating the results table in real-time.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Automatic Well Similarity Detection**
```javascript
// Identifies wells with similar characteristics using 30-metric ML features
areWellsSimilar(well1, well2, similarityThreshold = 0.8)
```
- **Metrics Compared**: amplitude, r2_score, snr, steepness, baseline
- **Similarity Algorithm**: Normalized difference calculation across all metrics
- **Threshold**: 80% similarity required for automatic re-evaluation

#### 2. **Multichannel-Aware Filtering**
```javascript
// Respects channel boundaries for batch processing
findSimilarWellsForBatchEvaluation(correctedWellKey, correctedWellData, expertClassification)
```
- **Channel Isolation**: Only processes wells within same fluorophore/channel
- **Pathogen Specificity**: Limits re-evaluation to same pathogen target
- **Independence**: FLUA/FAM corrections don't affect FLUB/HEX predictions

#### 3. **Automatic Workflow Integration**
```javascript
// Triggered automatically after expert feedback submission
executeAutomaticBatchReEvaluation(wellKey, wellData, expertClassification)
```
- **Auto-Execution**: Runs automatically after each expert correction (2-second delay)
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediately updates results table with new predictions
- **Non-Blocking**: Seamless workflow that doesn't interrupt normal operations

### Technical Implementation

#### Similarity Calculation Algorithm
```javascript
// Multi-metric similarity scoring with normalization
const metrics = ['amplitude', 'r2_score', 'snr', 'steepness', 'baseline'];
const similarityScore = metrics.reduce((score, metric) => {
    const maxVal = Math.max(Math.abs(val1), Math.abs(val2), 1);
    const difference = Math.abs(val1 - val2) / maxVal;
    return score + Math.max(0, 1 - difference);
}, 0) / metrics.length;
```

#### Multichannel Data Structure Support
```javascript
// Handles both single and multichannel data structures
if (currentAnalysisResults.fluorophore_data) {
    // Multichannel: process within fluorophore boundaries
    for (const [fluorophore, fluorophoreData] of Object.entries(currentAnalysisResults.fluorophore_data)) {
        // Channel-specific processing
    }
} else {
    // Single channel: process all wells with same pathogen
    for (const [wellKey, wellData] of Object.entries(currentAnalysisResults.well_data)) {
        // Standard processing
    }
}
```

### User Experience Flow

1. **Expert Correction**: User corrects ML prediction for a specific well
2. **Automatic Detection**: System identifies similar wells with different predictions
3. **Smart Notification**: Interactive popup shows breakdown by channel/pathogen
4. **User Choice**: Accept batch re-evaluation or skip
5. **Intelligent Processing**: Re-trains model and re-evaluates similar wells
6. **Results Update**: Display updates with new predictions and change summary

            <button class="ml-notification-btn secondary">✋ Skip Batch Re-evaluation</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Performance Characteristics

```javascript
// Default: 80% similarity required
const similarityThreshold = 0.8; // Adjustable from 0.5 to 0.95
```

#### Channel-Specific Processing
```javascript
// Pathogen extraction with multiple fallback methods
extractPathogenFromWell(wellData) {
    return wellData.specific_pathogen || 
           wellData.target || 
           getPathogenTarget(testCode, fluorophore) || 
           fluorophore;
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **Expert Feedback Submission**: `submitFeedback()` triggers batch evaluation
2. **ML Training Pipeline**: Uses enhanced 30-metric feature extraction
3. **Results Display**: `updateAnalysisResultsDisplay()` reflects changes
4. **Validation Dashboard**: Tracks batch re-evaluation events and outcomes

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Single expert correction improves multiple similar predictions
- **Consistency**: Ensures similar wells receive consistent classifications
- **Learning Acceleration**: Faster model improvement with propagated corrections
- **Multichannel Safety**: Respects channel boundaries to prevent cross-contamination
- **User Control**: Optional workflow with clear confirmation dialogs

**Last Updated**: July 28, 2025 - Multichannel-aware batch re-evaluation system implementation

## Recent Fixes (July 28, 2025)

### ML Validation Dashboard API Fix
**Issue**: "No item with that key" error in `/api/ml-validation-dashboard` endpoint
**Root Cause**: SQL query in `get_pathogen_dashboard_data()` was missing the `corrected` column but code was trying to access `row['corrected']`
**Solution**: Added `SUM(CASE WHEN teaching_outcome = 'prediction_corrected' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as corrected` to SQL query
**Files Modified**: 
- `ml_validation_tracker.py` - Fixed SQL query to include missing `corrected` column
- `app.py` - Enhanced error handling with specific error logging for each dashboard component

**Result**: ML validation dashboard now loads properly without key errors, showing expert decisions, teaching scores, and pathogen model performance metrics.
- Review model confidence scores for quality assurance
- Use feedback interface to continuously improve model accuracy
- Export training data for external analysis if needed

This documentation provides a complete overview of the ML curve classification system, from basic usage to advanced technical details. The system is designed to learn from expert knowledge and continuously improve qPCR analysis accuracy while maintaining transparency and user control.
