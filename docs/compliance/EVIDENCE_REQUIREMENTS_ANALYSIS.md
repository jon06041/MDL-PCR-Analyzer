20. **CFR_11_10_D** - Electronic signatures (app monitors Entra ID authentication usage)
21. **ENTRA_SSO_INTEGRATION** - SSO authentication (app tracks SSO usage patterns)

### üéØ **Implementation Strategy**

**All 21 requirements should have app evidence tracking** because:
- **16 requirements**: App provides complete or primary evidence
- **3 requirements**: App provides significant supporting operational evidence
- **2 requirements**: App monitors and verifies external systems are working

**No requirements should be completely removed** - the app can contribute meaningful evidence to every compliance requirement, either as primary evidence or as supporting operational proof.

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Primary App-Generated Evidence:
- **Complete Evidence**: App provides all necessary evidence for compliance
- **Focus**: Track comprehensive operational data and system capabilities
- **Examples**: Data integrity logs, QC execution, ML model performance

### For Partial App Evidence + External Documentation:
- **Supporting Evidence**: App provides operational proof that complements external documentation
- **Focus**: Demonstrate system is working as validated/documented
- **Examples**: Test results showing accuracy (supports IQ/OQ/PQ), performance metrics (supports validation studies)

### For App-Monitored Evidence:
- **Operational Monitoring**: App tracks that external systems are functioning correctly
- **Focus**: Prove external requirements are being met in practice
- **Examples**: Authentication success logs (proves Entra ID is working), SSO usage tracking

### Universal Implementation Principles:

#### **Evidence Quality Over Quantity**
- Focus on meaningful evidence that demonstrates compliance
- Avoid individual file tracking without context
- Include control samples and validation data in all relevant evidence

#### **Operational Proof**
- Demonstrate that requirements are met through actual system operation
- Show the system works correctly, not just that it's configured correctly
- Provide evidence that validates external documentation claims

#### **Audit-Ready Evidence**
- Structure evidence to be easily understood by auditors
- Include context and interpretation, not just raw data
- Link operational evidence to specific regulatory requirements

---

## Quality Control Strategy

### **Evidence Should Include Control Samples**
For any qPCR analysis evidence:
- **Positive controls** - verify system sensitivity
- **Negative controls** - verify specificity
- **Internal controls** - verify sample quality
- **Quantification standards** - verify accuracy

### **Evidence Should NOT Include**
- Individual patient sample results
- Individual well measurements without controls
- Raw fluorescence data without analysis context
- Individual ML predictions without performance context

## Conclusion

This analysis shows that **all 21 compliance requirements** can benefit from app-generated evidence, with varying levels of contribution:

- **16 requirements**: App provides complete or primary evidence for full compliance
- **3 requirements**: App provides significant supporting operational evidence to complement external documentation
- **2 requirements**: App monitors and demonstrates that external systems (like Entra ID) are functioning properly

**Key Principle**: The app should capture **all evidence it can reasonably provide** - whether primary, supporting, or monitoring evidence. This maximizes the value of the compliance tracking system and provides auditors with comprehensive operational proof that requirements are being met in practice.

**Strategic Advantage**: By tracking evidence for all requirements, the app becomes a central compliance hub that demonstrates the system is not only documented correctly but also operating correctly in real-world usage.
