## Database Schema

The system uses a comprehensive database schema with the following key tables:

- **software_versions** - Version control and change management
- **user_access_log** - 21 CFR Part 11 audit trail
- **quality_control_runs** - CLIA QC compliance
- **method_validation_studies** - Method performance validation
- **instrument_qualification** - Equipment qualification tracking
- **adverse_events** - MDR compliance and event tracking
- **risk_assessments** - ISO 14971 risk management
- **personnel_training** - Training and competency records
- **data_integrity_audit** - Electronic records integrity
- **post_market_surveillance** - Performance monitoring
- **supplier_management** - Third-party vendor compliance

## Compliance Scoring

The system calculates an overall compliance score based on:

1. **Software Version Control** - Version validation status
2. **Quality Control** - QC pass rates (≥95% required)
3. **Method Validation** - Study completion status
4. **Instrument Status** - Qualification currency
5. **Risk Management** - Unacceptable risks (must be 0)
6. **Training Compliance** - Pass rates (≥90% required)
7. **Data Integrity** - Audit trail completeness
8. **User Activity** - System success rates (≥98% required)

**Scoring Thresholds:**
- **90-100%**: Fully compliant (Green)
- **70-89%**: Minor issues (Yellow)
