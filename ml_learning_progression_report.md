## ðŸŽ¯ Sample Type Breakdown

### Perfect Accuracy Achieved Across All Categories:

**Strong Positives (2/2)**: 100%
- High amplitude, excellent r2, early CQJ values
- ML confidence: 0.92 (both samples)

**Weak Positives (6/6)**: 100%  
- Borderline cases where rule-based struggled
- ML confidence: 0.65 - 0.97 (learned to distinguish true positives)

**Negatives (4/4)**: 100%
- Clear negatives: Rule-based (0.50 confidence)
- Tricky negatives: ML predictions (0.84-0.94 confidence)

**Suspicious (6/6)**: 100%
- Complex cases requiring expert judgment
- ML confidence: 0.66 - 0.79 (appropriate caution)

**Edge Cases (2/2)**: 100%
- Very late positive: Correctly classified as SUSPICIOUS
- Sharp rise: Correctly upgraded to STRONG_POSITIVE

## ðŸš€ Performance Improvements

### What Changed from Baseline:
1. **Eliminated False Flags**: Rule-based flagged 13/20 as SUSPICIOUS, ML correctly classified all
2. **Improved Sensitivity**: Detected all weak positives that rule-based missed
3. **Maintained Specificity**: No false positives in final results
4. **Pathogen Awareness**: Different thresholds for NGON vs CT pathogens

### System Robustness:
- **Feature Compatibility**: Handled r2/r2_score naming variations
- **Missing Data**: Graceful handling of invalid CQJ/CalcJ values
- **Mixed Methods**: Seamless integration of ML and rule-based approaches
- **Confidence Scoring**: Realistic confidence levels for different sample types
