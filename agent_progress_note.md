# Agent Progress Note (July 10, 2025)

## Context
- User is working on the qPCR analyzer app, specifically on the threshold strategy dropdown and scale synchronization logic.
- The main goal is to ensure the threshold strategy dropdown always matches the current scale (log/linear) on load and after toggling, and that the selected strategy persists and is always valid for the current scale.
- Multiple attempts were made to robustly update the `populateThresholdStrategyDropdown` function in `static/script.js` to achieve this, but the change did not appear to take effect in the UI (possibly due to caching, site issues, or other factors).
- User is preparing to commit and push changes to switch computers, even though the dropdown fix is not yet confirmed to work.

## Details
- The correct robust implementation for `populateThresholdStrategyDropdown` was provided and should be present in the file. It ensures:
  - The dropdown is repopulated with the correct strategies for the current scale.
  - If the previously selected strategy is not available in the new scale, it defaults to the first available strategy.
  - The internal state (`window.selectedThresholdStrategy`) is always synchronized with the dropdown value.
- The user has made some manual edits to `static/script.js`.
- Next steps after switching computers: verify that the robust dropdown logic is present and working, and continue debugging if the issue persists.

## Outstanding Issue
- The dropdown for threshold strategies does not always match the current scale on load/toggle, despite the correct logic being present in the code. Further investigation may be needed after switching computers.

This note is for continuity and handoff. See `static/script.js` for the latest attempted fix.
