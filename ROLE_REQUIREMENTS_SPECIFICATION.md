## üîê Permission Implementation Strategy

### Current Status ‚úÖ
- **Database Schema**: Authentication tables exist and working
- **Role Definitions**: Complete role hierarchy implemented
- **Permission Mapping**: All permissions mapped to roles
- **Authentication**: Dual Entra ID + local authentication working

### Next Steps üöÄ

#### 1. **Research User File Upload Enhancement**
Implement flexible file upload system for research users:

```python
@require_permission('upload_non_standard_files')
@app.route('/api/upload-research')
def research_upload():
    # Allow files without naming convention requirements
    # Provide manual mapping interface for file type/channel assignment
```

#### 2. **Administrator Exclusive Features Protection**
Ensure ONLY administrators can access exclusive administrative functions:

```javascript
// Show administrative features ONLY for administrators
if (userPermissions.includes('system_reset')) {
    showResetButton();  // Only administrators see this
}
if (userPermissions.includes('database_management')) {
    showBackupManager();  // Only administrators see this
}
// Administrators have access to ALL other features too
```

#### 3. **Permission Middleware Implementation**
Create Flask decorators to enforce permissions on API endpoints:

```python
@require_permission('upload_files')
@app.route('/api/upload')
def upload_endpoint():
    # Only users with upload_files permission can access
```

#### 4. **Research User File Upload Interface**
Create specialized upload interface for research users:
- **Manual File Type Selection**: Dropdown to specify amplification vs summary files
- **Channel Assignment**: Manual fluorophore channel mapping
- **Validation Override**: Research-specific validation rules
- **Naming Convention Bypass**: Upload files with any naming pattern

#### 2. **Frontend Permission Control**
Hide/show UI elements based on user permissions:

```javascript
// Show upload button only if user has upload_files permission
if (userPermissions.includes('upload_files')) {
    showUploadButton();
}
```

#### 3. **Role Management Interface**
Create admin interface for:
- User role assignment
- Permission verification
- Audit log viewing
- Role-based reporting

#### 4. **Compliance Integration**
Link role permissions to FDA compliance requirements:
- QC Technician validation ‚Üí 21 CFR Part 11 compliance
- Compliance Officer oversight ‚Üí Audit trail requirements
- Administrator controls ‚Üí System security requirements

2. **Frontend Permission Gates**: Hide restricted UI elements
3. **File Upload Restrictions**: Enforce upload permissions
4. **Analysis Restrictions**: Protect ML and advanced analysis features

### Phase 2: Advanced Role Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **Role Management UI**: Admin interface for user/role management
2. **Permission Audit**: Track permission usage and access patterns
3. **Role-Based Dashboards**: Customize dashboards per role
4. **Workflow Enforcement**: Multi-step approval workflows

### Phase 3: Compliance Integration (ONGOING)
1. **FDA Mapping**: Link permissions to specific FDA requirements
2. **Audit Reporting**: Generate compliance reports by role
3. **Validation Workflows**: Implement QC approval processes
4. **Access Documentation**: Automatic audit trail generation

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Role Testing Matrix
- [ ] **Viewer**: Can only view, cannot modify anything
- [ ] **Lab Technician**: Can upload and run basic analysis only
- [ ] **QC Technician**: Can validate results and train ML models
- [ ] **Research User**: Same as QC + flexible file uploads with manual mapping
- [ ] **Compliance Officer**: Can manage requirements and audit access
- [ ] **Administrator**: **FULL access to ALL features** + exclusive access to reset button and database backups

### Security Testing
- [ ] **Permission Bypass**: Verify users cannot access restricted features
- [ ] **Administrative Exclusivity**: Ensure ONLY administrators can access reset/backup functions
- [ ] **API Security**: Test API endpoints respect permission requirements
- [ ] **Session Security**: Verify role changes require re-authentication

- `created_at`, `last_login`, `is_active`

### Sessions Table (`user_sessions`) 
- `session_id`, `user_id`, `username`, `role`, `auth_method`
